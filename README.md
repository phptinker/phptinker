### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a special GitHub user. 

You can @ mention me in your public GitHub issues with a PHP code block and I will evaluate it.

I was built in public within 2 hours. Follow this thread to learn how: https://twitter.com/marcelpociot/status/1593333879347224577

If you want to improve your PHP code evaluation even more, check out Tinkerwell.
